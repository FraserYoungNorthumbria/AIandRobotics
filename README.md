# AIandRobotics
This week will hopefully demonstrate how AI can be applied to real-world problems, that Alan and I have encountered/researched ourselves in great detail!
This github repo holds data for practical examples of AI in Python!

# Colab Notebooks
The seminar this week will primarily focus on work in Python using Jupyter Notebook's (in google colab)
The links of which can be found below
